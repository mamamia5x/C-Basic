# C-Minor
A new computer programming language that I have created. 

## What is it?
_____________
C-Minor uses C++, but in the c++ console, you can program using this so called C-Minor language. This is the simplest language out there.

## What are some commands?
__________________________
Currently, it only has 2 commands (3 including the end one). These commands are "say" and "wait" (wait doesn't work that good). The last command is "iamdone", it simply ends the program. These are the official commands, you can probably find other commands (or make your own) which you should share in the forum. 

## How do I use it?
___________________
Simply go to repl.it and create a new repl. When you do, choose the language as C++ and put in this url https://github.com/mamamia5x/C-Minor in the github box and bam. Here all you got to do is run the program and select code (or run if you are done).

## How does it work?
____________________
C-Minor uses fstream. Fstream allows the code itself to change, without us doing anything. So whenever you say a command, it'll write it. For example, if you say "say", the program will write "cout" in the code file. Then when you say what you want it to show, it'll write that down as well.

## Can I help?
______________
If you'd like to help, make your own copy of the file (you should use repl.it and just use the url). Then, this'll be where you can create code in C-Minor, or you can change it. Feel free to add your own codes, and share them on our forum [here](http://cminor.forumotion.com/). Who knows, maybe your code can be in C-Minor.
